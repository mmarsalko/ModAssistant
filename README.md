### This fork of ModAssistant removes anti-piracy measures and client auto-updates
Buy Beat Saber! Seriously, it's very good! These builds are intended for modding an old version of Beat Saber (v1.5.0).

### BSIPA
After running ModAssistant to install your mods, your BSIPA files will likely be replaced with something that have their own anti-piracy measures. There is a build that fixes that [here](https://github.com/Ynng/BeatSaber-IPA-Reloaded/releases/tag/3.13.2-p). Keep a copy backed up in case it gets overwritten again.
